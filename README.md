<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [ TDD Setup ] <a name="about-project"></a>

>The TDD Setup project focuses on implementing the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. The goal of this project is to create a class with multiple methods, following the TDD approach, which emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code.

<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>
- **Factorial Calculation: The Solver class provides a method for calculating the factorial of a given integer. It handles special cases, such as 0 and negative numbers.**

- **String Reversal: The Solver class includes a method to reverse a given string.**

- **FizzBuzz Game: The Solver class implements the FizzBuzz game rules, returning different values based on the input number's divisibility by 3 and 5.**

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD): The project follows TDD principles, with tests written before the implementation code using RSpec framework.**

<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- [ ] **[Error Handling and Validation: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected input and validate user inputs, ensuring the Solver class operates reliably and gracefully handles edge cases.]**
- [ ] **[Additional Mathematical Operations: Expand the Solver class by incorporating more mathematical operations like calculating square roots or finding prime numbers, offering a wider range of mathematical functionalities.]**
- [ ] **[String Manipulation Methods: Enhance the Solver class with additional string manipulation methods such as checking for palindromes or extracting substrings based on patterns, allowing for more versatile string operations.]**
